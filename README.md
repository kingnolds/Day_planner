# <Day_planner>
## Description
This is a Day Planner that allows you to enter and save tasks for each hour of the work day and has an indicator to show times that are past present and upcoming. The tasked are saved to local storage to show up whenever the page is loaded

This project was done utilizing Bootstrap, Moment, JQUERY, and JavaScript 

I learned about manipulating bootstrap classes to affect the layout, moment formats, and Jquery dom traversal and click events.
